## Welcome to my website!

I hold a Ph.D in economics from the [Department of Economics at the Pennsylvania State University](https://econ.la.psu.edu/).

I am interested in exploring questions in Applied Microeconomics, particularly within Public Economics, Labor Economics, and Industrial Organization. My current research focuses on quantifying the welfare effects of non-linear pricing, analyzing barriers to formal labor market access for vulnerable populations, and studying policies to promote the growth of small firms.
