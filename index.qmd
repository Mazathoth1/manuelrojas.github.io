## Welcome to my website!

I hold a Ph.D in economics from the [Department of Economics at the Pennsylvania State University](https://econ.la.psu.edu/).

I am interested in exploring questions in Applied Microeconomics, particularly within Industrial Organization and Public Economics. My current research focuses on quantifying the welfare effects of non-linear pricing, studying policies to promote the growth of small firms, and analyzing barriers to formal labor market access for vulnerable populations.

Here you can find my [CV](https://mazathoth1.github.io/manuelrojas.github.io/CV/CV.html).
