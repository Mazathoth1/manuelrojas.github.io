## Welcome to my website!

I am Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics at the Pennsylvania State University](https://econ.la.psu.edu/) and I am on the job market for the 2023-24 academic year.

I am interested in exploring questions at the intersection of Industrial Organization and Public Economics. Currently, my research focuses on quantifying the effects of non-linear prices on welfare and competition, using both reduced form and structural methods.

You can find my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4wqlz6qmmjzovny2tpq8y/CV-Manuel-Rojas.pdf?rlkey=vr4nv0cp5w0sraijq7u83golq&dl=0).
