## Welcome to my website!

I am Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics at the Pennsylvania State University](https://econ.la.psu.edu/) and I am on the job market for the 2023-24 academic year.

I am interested in exploring questions at the intersection of Industrial Organization and Public Economics. Currently, my research focuses on quantifying the effects of non-linear prices on welfare and competition, using both reduced form and structural methods.

Please find my CV [here](https://mazathoth1.github.io/manuelrojas.github.io//CV/cv_Rojas_Manuel.pdf) and the latest version of my Job Market Paper in this [link](https://github.com/Mazathoth1/manuelrojas.github.io/raw/4ea0bf23a1804e0a51acada821cb2226f148854e/Research/JMP_Rojas_Manuel.pdf).
