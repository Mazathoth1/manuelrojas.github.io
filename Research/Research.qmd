### Distributional Effects of a Non-Linear Price Scheme in Public Utilities. (Job Market Paper)

Nonlinear pricing schemes are the primary instruments that policymakers use to ensure access to public utilities for low-income households while penalizing high-income households for overconsumption. In this paper, I evaluate the effectiveness of these pricing schemes and introduce a novel methodology to analyze their impact on the distribution of consumption and welfare in public utilities, with a specific focus on the case of water utilities in Bogot치, Colombia. To achieve this, I employ a combination of reduced-form and structural model techniques, leveraging Bogot치's unique context, where households have historically encountered diverse pricing schemes, including the introduction of additional nonlinear elements in the pricing scheme through a 2012 policy change. Notably, the results reveal that the nonlinear pricing scheme exhibits regressive characteristics, benefiting wealthier households with higher consumption levels and more significant welfare gains. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that income effects, driven by changes in the virtual incomes of households, are the primary driving force behind these outcomes. These findings underscore the necessity for an alternative approach to achieving more significant equity in the distribution of benefits within public utilities.

Szabo (2015) analyzes the effects of a free water allowance in South Africa equal to the World Health Organization's recommended minimum. The author demonstrates that the free allowance acts as a lump-sum subsidy without significantly affecting water consumption. Furthermore, it is shown that it is possible to reallocate the current subsidy to form an optimal tariff without needing a free allowance. In this study, we revisit Szabo's analysis using data from Bogot치, Colombia, where a similar policy was implemented. First, employing the methodology proposed by the author, we successfully replicate the original results on consumption, revealing a minimal impact. Second, we reexamine the calculation of the price elasticities for water, identifying lower price elasticities. Third, we replicate the exercise of creating an optimal tariff that increases social welfare.

# Work in Progress

### Competitive Bundling and Switching Costs.

In this project, I examine the implications of second-degree price discrimination on competition and switching costs. I estimate a demand model for bundles by employing a random utility discrete choice model. The challenge lies in the fact that firms use price discrimination to tailor their offerings to different market segments and employ bundling as a competitive strategy. To address this challenge, I leverage the variation in my data, which covers multiple locations and socioeconomic variables, enabling a comprehensive analysis. This research offers insights into a complex issue, addresses theoretical gaps, and evaluates various policy scenarios.
